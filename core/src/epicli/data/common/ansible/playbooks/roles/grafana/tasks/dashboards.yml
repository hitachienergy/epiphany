    # As noted in [1] an exported dashboard replaces the exporter's datasource
    # name with a representative name, something like 'DS_GRAPHITE'. The name
    # is different for each datasource plugin, but always begins with 'DS_'.
    # In the rest of the data, the same name is used, but captured in braces,
    # for example: '${DS_GRAPHITE}'.
    #
    # [1] http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/#import-sharing-with-grafana-2-x-or-3-0
    #
    # The data structure looks (massively abbreviated) something like:
    #
    #   "name": "DS_GRAPHITE",
    #   "datasource": "${DS_GRAPHITE}",
    #
    # If we import the downloaded dashboard verbatim, it will not automatically
    # be connected to the data source like we want it. The Grafana UI expects
    # us to do the final connection by hand, which we do not want to do.
    # So, in the below task we ensure that we replace instances of this string
    # with the data source name we want.
    # To make sure that we're not being too greedy with the regex replacement
    # of the data source to use for each dashboard that's uploaded, we make the
    # regex match very specific by using the following:
    #
    # 1. Literal boundaries for " on either side of the match.
    # 2. Non-capturing optional group matches for the ${} bits which may, or
    #    or may not, be there..
    # 3. A case-sensitive literal match for DS .
    # 4. A one-or-more case-sensitive match for the part that follows the
    #    underscore, with only A-Z, 0-9 and - or _ allowed.
    #
    # This regex can be tested and understood better by looking at the
    # matches and non-matches in https://regex101.com/r/f4Gkvg/6
