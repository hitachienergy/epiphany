  # It's difficult to determine universal value for retries since it depends on many factors (including hardware).

  #   After a node service restart, the cluster can take a long time to return to green.
  #   Thatâ€™s the reason for the lines retries: 500 and delay: 15. It means we will wait 125 minutes (500 x 15 seconds)
  #   for the cluster to return to green. You might need to adjust that if your nodes hold a really huge amount of data.
  #   For the majority of cases, it is way more than enough.
  # We decided to start with ~ 60 min. We observed additional delay between retries on cloud (~ 1s).
  # Calculation: 60 min = 3600 s / 2 [delay] / 2 [additional delay (SSH / REST API)] = 900
  retries: 900
  delay: 2
