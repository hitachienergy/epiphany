# The default values below were chosen as a compromise between node stability when available resources are low
# and utilization (costs) to support even SMALL size VMs and may need to be adjusted depending on your environment.
# Typically 5-10% of node resources should be reserved to protect nodes, higher is safer. The values depend on various
# environment specific factors like workload density so there's no simple way to determine safe numbers automatically.
# Tuning these values may be an iterative process.
