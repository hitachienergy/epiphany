# A standalone version of this procedure can be found in tools/development/k8s/memory/patch_cgroup_driver/.
# It has been reported that Epiphany behaves unstable with high resource utilization, this patch seems to be fixing these problems.

# K8s documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#cgroup-drivers) states:
# > A single cgroup manager simplifies the view of what resources are being allocated and will by default have a more consistent view of the available and in-use resources.
# > When there are two cgroup managers on a system, you end up with two views of those resources.
# > In the field, people have reported cases where nodes that are configured to use cgroupfs for the kubelet and Docker,
# > but systemd for the rest of the processes, become unstable under resource pressure.
