  logrotate:
    # Configuration partly based on /etc/logrotate.d/postgresql-common provided by 'postgresql-common' package from Ubuntu repo.
      # PostgreSQL from Ubuntu repo:
        # By default 'logging_collector' is disabled, so 'log_directory' parameter is ignored.
        # Default log path is /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-$version-$cluster.log.
      # PostgreSQL from SCL repo (RHEL):
        # By default 'logging_collector' is enabled and there is up to 7 files named 'daily' (e.g. postgresql-Wed.log)
        # and thus they can be overwritten by built-in log facility to provide rotation.
    # To have similar configuration for both distros (with logrotate), 'log_filename' parameter is modified.
