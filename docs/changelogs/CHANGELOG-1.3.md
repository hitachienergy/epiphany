### Deprecated

### Breaking changes

- **Ubuntu 18.04 is not supported**. For Ubuntu, only release 20.04 is supported and upgrade from 18.04 is not handled by Epiphany.
For more information, see [How to upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04](../home/howto/OS_UPGRADE.md#how-to-upgrade-from-ubuntu-1804-to-2004).
- PgBouncer available only as Kubernetes service

### Known issues

- Upgrading Kubernetes to the latest available version 1.22 breaks the Vault and Istio components as versions are not compatible. The issues are not being addressed as these components are being considered for deprecation and removal in subsequent releases.
- Kafka exporter for Prometheus: Performance issue on large clusters. We use version 1.4.0 since 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 contain critical bug (see https://github.com/danielqsj/kafka_exporter/issues/273). For release notes, see https://github.com/danielqsj/kafka_exporter/releases.
