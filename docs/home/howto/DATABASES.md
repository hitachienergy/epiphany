## How to migrate from PostgreSQL installed from Software Collections to installed from PostgreSQL repository

This operation is only required for RedHat/CentOS installations with PostgreSQL 10 installed from Software Collections.

This change is required due to additional modules added by Epiphany that are not supported by PostgreSQL installed from Software
Collections, but are supported by PostgreSQL installed from official PostgreSQL repository. That's why PostgreSQL 10 installed from RedHat/CentOS Software Collections needs to be replaced with PostgreSQL 10 installed from PostgreSQL repository.

### PostgreSQL servers

0). Check if package rh-postgresql10-postgresql-server is installed. You can check this with command:

```bash
rpm -qa | grep rh-postgresql10-postgresql-server
```

1). Stop instance of PostgreSQL installed from Software Collections database with command:

```bash
systemctl stop postgresql
```

2). Prepare backup of your PostgreSQL data directory - e.g. with tar command:

```bash
tar -cf backup.tar /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql10/lib/pgsql/data/
```

But any other tool that will provide you reliable backup that will prevent you from data loss can be chosen.

3). Create new directory for your PostgreSQL with command:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/lib/pgsql/10/data/
```

4). Copy/move content of whole data folder to previously created directory:

```bash
cp -R /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql10/lib/pgsql/data/* /var/lib/pgsql/10/data/
```

5). Remove unnecessary packages with command:

```bash
yum erase rh-postgresql10-postgresql-server rh-postgresql10-postgresql-contrib rh-postgresql10-postgresql \
rh-postgresql10-postgresql-libs \
rh-postgresql10-runtime yum erase postgresql10-libs
```

6). Change ownership of folder /var/lib/pgsql/ and all folders below to user and group postgres with command:

```bash
chown -R postgres:postgres -R /var/lib/pgsql
```

7). Provide configuration to PostgreSQL component with Epiphany configuration. Please refer to Epiphany HOWTO.md for more details.

### Online mode - Repository server

1). Ensure that on repository server file /tmp/epi-download-requirements/download-requirements-done.flag doesn't exist to force downloading new packages.

### Offline mode - machine to which you want to download packages for airgapped deployment:

1).  Ensure that you have downloaded package that name stars with postgresql10-server. Refer to documentation about airgapped 
[installation](/docs/home/howto/CLUSTER.md#how-to-create-an-epiphany-cluster-on-existing-air-gapped-infrastructure)
for more details. If package doesn't exist re-run download-requirements.sh script again.

## How to configure PostgreSQL

To configure PostgreSQL, login to server using ssh and switch to `postgres` user with command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres -i
```

Then configure database server using psql according to your needs and
[PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

## How to set up PostgreSQL connection pooling

PostgreSQL connection pooling in Epiphany is served by PgBouncer application. This might be added as a feature if needed.
Simplest configuration runs PGBouncer on PostgreSQL master node. This needs to be enabled in configuration yaml file:

```yaml
kind: configuration/postgresql
...
specification:
  additional_components:
    pgbouncer:
      enabled: yes
  ...
```
PgBouncer listens on standard port 6432. Basic configuration is just template, with very limited access to database. This is because security reasons. [Configuration needs to be tailored according component documentation and stick to security rules and best practices](http://www.pgbouncer.org/).

PgBouncer can be also installed (together with Pgpool) in K8s cluster. See [How to set up PgBouncer, PgPool and PostgreSQL parameters](#how-to-set-up-pgbouncer-pgpool-and-postgresql-parameters).

## How to set up PostgreSQL HA replication with repmgr cluster

This component can be used as a part of PostgreSQL clustering configured by Epiphany. In order to configure PostgreSQL HA 
replication, add to your data.yaml a block similar to the one below to core section:

```yaml
---
kind: configuration/postgresql
name: default
title: PostgreSQL
specification:
  config_file:
    parameter_groups:
      ...
      # This block is optional, you can use it to override default values
      - name: REPLICATION
        subgroups:
          - name: Sending Server(s)
            parameters:
              - name: max_wal_senders
                value: 10 # default value
                comment: maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes
                when: replication
              - name: wal_keep_segments
                value: 34 # default value
                comment: number of WAL files held for standby servers
                when: replication
          - name: Standby Servers
            parameters:
              - name: hot_standby
                value: 'on' # default value
                comment: must be 'on' for repmgr needs, ignored on primary but recommended in case primary becomes standby
                when: replication
  extensions:
    ...
    replication:
      enabled: true
      replication_user_name: your_priviledged_user_name
      replication_user_password: PASSWORD_TO_CHANGE
      priviledged_user_name: your_priviledged_user_name
      priviledged_user_password: PASSWORD_TO_CHANGE
      use_repmgr: true
      repmgr_database: repmgr
      shared_preload_libraries:
        - repmgr
```
If `enabled` is set to `yes` in `replication`, then Epiphany will automatically create cluster of primary and secondary server
with replication user with name and password specified in data.yaml. This is only possible for configurations containing two
PostgreSQL servers.

Priviledged user is used to perform full backup of primary instance and replicate this at the beginning to secondary node. After 
that for replication only replication user with limited permissions is used for WAL replication.

## How to register database standby in repmgr cluster

If one of database nodes has been recovered to desired state you may want to re-attach it to database cluster. Execute these steps on node which will be attached as standby:

1. Clone data from current primary node:

```bash
repmgr standby clone -h CURRENT_PRIMARY_ADDRESS -U epi_repmgr_admin -d epi_repmgr --force
```

2. Register node as standby

```bash
repmgr standby register
```
You may use option --force if the node was registered in cluster before.
For more options see repmgr manual:
https://repmgr.org/docs/4.0/repmgr-standby-register.html

## How to switchover database nodes

For some reason you may want to switchover database nodes (promote standby to primary and demote existing primary to standby).

1. Configure passwordless SSH comunication for postgres user between database nodes.

2. Test and run initial login between nodes to authenticate host (if host authentication is enabled).

Execute commands listed below on actual standby node

3. Confirm that standby you want to promote is registered in repmgr cluster:

```bash
repmgr cluster show
```

4. Run switchover:

```bash
repmgr standby switchover
```

5. Run command from step 3 and check status. For more details or troubleshooting see repmgr manual:
https://repmgr.org/docs/4.0/repmgr-standby-switchover.html

## How to set up PgBouncer, Pgpool and PostgreSQL parameters

This section describes how to set up connection pooling and load balancing for highly available PostgreSQL cluster.
The default configuration provided by Epiphany is meant for midrange class systems but can be customized to scale up 
or to improve performance.

To adjust the configuration to your needs, you can refer to the following documentation:

Component | Documentation URL |
--- | --- |
PgBouncer | https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html |
Pgpool: Performance Considerations | https://www.pgpool.net/docs/41/en/html/performance.html |
Pgpool: Server Configuration | https://www.pgpool.net/docs/41/en/html/runtime-config.html |
PostgreSQL: connections | https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-connection.html |
PostgreSQL: resources management | https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html |

### Installing PgBouncer and Pgpool

PgBouncer and Pgpool are provided as K8s deployments. By default they are not installed. To deploy them you need to add "configuration/applications" document to your configuration yaml file, similar to the example below (`enabled` flags must be set as `true`):

```yaml
---
kind: configuration/applications
version: 0.6.0

        RESERVE_POOL_SIZE: 25
        POOL_MODE: transaction
```

### Default setup - main parameters

This chapter describes the default setup and main parameters responsible for the perfomance limitations.
The limitations can be divided into 3 layers: resource usage, connection limits and query caching.
All of the configuration parameters can be modified in the configuration yaml file.

#### Resource usage

Each of the components has hardware requirements that depend on its configuration, in particular on the number of allowed connections.

##### PgBouncer

```yaml
    replicas: 2
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 128Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 128Mi
```

##### Pgpool

```yaml
    replicas: 3
    resources: # Adjust to your configuration, see https://www.pgpool.net/docs/41/en/html/resource-requiremente.html
      limits:
        # cpu: 900m # Set according to your env
        memory: 176Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 250m # Adjust to your env, increase if possible
        memory: 176Mi
```

By default, each Pgpool pod requires 176 MB of memory. This value has been determined based on Pgpool [docs](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/41/en/html/resource-requiremente.html), however after stress testing we need to add several extra megabytes to avoid [failed to fork a child](https://github.com/hitachienergy/epiphany/pull/1123) issue.
You may need to adjust `resources` after changing `num_init_children` or `max_pool` (`PGPOOL_MAX_POOL`) settings.
Such changes should be synchronized with PostgreSQL and PgBouncer configuration.

##### PostgreSQL

Memory related parameters have PostgreSQL default values.
If your setup requires performance improvments, you may consider changing values of the following parameters:

- shared_buffers
- work_mem
- maintenance _work_mem
- effective_cache_size
- temp_buffers

The default settings can be overridden by Epiphany using `configuration/postgresql` doc in the configuration yaml file.

#### Connection limits

##### PgBouncer

There are connection limitations defined in PgBouncer configuration. Each of these parameters is defined per PgBouncer instance (pod).
For example, having 2 pods (with MAX_CLIENT_CONN = 150) allows for up to 300 client connections.

```yaml
    pgbouncer:
      env:
        ...
        MAX_CLIENT_CONN: 150
        DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE: 25
        RESERVE_POOL_SIZE: 25
        POOL_MODE: transaction
```

##### Pgpool

By default, Pgpool service is configured to handle up to 93 active concurrent connections to PostgreSQL (3 pods x 31). This is because of the following settings:

```
num_init_children = 32
reserved_connections = 1
```

Each pod can handle up to 32 concurrent connections but one is [reserved](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/41/en/html/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-NUM-INIT-CHILDREN).
This means that the 32th connection from a client will be refused.
Keep in mind that canceling a query creates another connection to PostgreSQL, thus, a query cannot be canceled if all the connections are in use.
Furthermore, for each pod, one connection slot must be available for K8s health checks.
Hence the real number of available concurrent connections is 30 per pod.

If you need more active concurrent connections, you can increase the number of pods (`replicas`) but the total number of allowed concurrent connections should not exceed the value defined by PostgreSQL parameters: (`max_connections` - `superuser_reserved_connections`).

In order to change Pgpool settings (defined in pgpool.conf), you can edit `pgpool_conf_content_to_append` section:

```yaml
      pgpool_conf_content_to_append: |
        #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # CUSTOM SETTINGS (appended by Epiphany to override defaults)
        #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        connection_life_time = 900
        reserved_connections = 1
```

The content of pgpool.conf file is stored in K8s `pgpool-config-files` ConfigMap.

For detailed information about connection tunning, see "Performance Considerations" chapter in Pgpool documentation.

##### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL uses `max_connections` parameter to limit the number of client connections to database server.
The default is typically 100 connections.
Generally, PostgreSQL on sufficient amount of hardware can support a few hundred connections.

#### Query caching

Query caching is not available in PgBouncer.

##### Pgpool

Query caching is disabled by default in Pgpool configuration.

##### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is installed with default settings.


## How to set up PostgreSQL audit logging

Audit logging of database activities is available through the PostgreSQL Audit Extension: [pgAudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/blob/REL_10_STABLE/README.md).
It provides session and/or object audit logging via the standard PostgreSQL log.

pgAudit may generate a large volume of logging, which has an impact on performance and log storage.
For this reason, pgAudit is not enabled by default.

To install and configure pgAudit, add to your configuration yaml file a doc similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: configuration/postgresql
title: PostgreSQL
name: default
provider: aws
version: 0.5.2
specification:
  extensions:
    pgaudit:
      enabled: yes
      config_file_parameters:
        ## postgresql standard
        log_connections: 'off'
        log_disconnections: 'off'
        log_statement: 'none'
        log_line_prefix: "'%m [%p] %q%u@%d,host=%h '"
        ## pgaudit specific, see https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/blob/REL_10_STABLE/README.md#settings
        pgaudit.log: "'write, function, role, ddl' # 'misc_set' is not supported for PG 10"
        pgaudit.log_catalog: 'off # to reduce overhead of logging'
        # the following first 2 parameters are set to values that make it easier to access audit log per table
        # change their values to the opposite if you need to reduce overhead of logging
        pgaudit.log_relation: 'on # separate log entry for each relation'
        pgaudit.log_statement_once: 'off'
        pgaudit.log_parameter: 'on'
```

If `specification.extensions.pgaudit.enabled` is set to `yes`, Epiphany will install pgAudit package
and add pgaudit extension to be loaded in [shared_preload_libraries](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SHARED-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES).
Settings defined in `config_file_parameters` section are populated to Epiphany managed PostgreSQL configuration
file. Using this section, you can also set any additional parameter if needed (e.g. `pgaudit.role`) but keep in mind
that these settings are global.

To configure pgAudit according to your needs, see [pgAudit documentation](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/blob/REL_10_STABLE/README.md#settings).

Once Epiphany installation is complete, there is one manual action at database level (per each database). Connect to your database
using a client (like psql) and load pgaudit extension into current database by running command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgaudit;
```

To remove the extension from database, run:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS pgaudit;
```

## How to configure PostgreSQL replication

#### Note

This feature is deprecated and will be removed.
Use [PostgreSQL HA replication with repmgr](#how-to-set-up-postgresql-ha-replication-with-repmgr-cluster) instead.

#### Attention

In version 0.6.0 because of delivering full HA for PostgreSQL we needed to change configuration for PostgreSQL native
replication.

You need to change old configuration file from the one like this:

```yaml
kind: configuration/postgresql
name: default
title: PostgreSQL
provider: aws
specification:
  replication:
    enabled: yes
    user: your_postgresql_replication_user
    password: your_postgresql_replication_password
    max_wal_senders: 10 # (optional) - default value 5
    wal_keep_segments: 34 # (optional) - default value 32
```

to one described below.

old value | new value |
--- | --- |
specification.replication.enabled | specification.extensions.replication.enabled |
specification.replication.user | specification.extensions.replication.replication_user_name |
specification.replication.password | specification.extensions.replication.replication_user_password |
specification.replication.max_wal_senders | defined in subgroups section |
specification.replication.wal_keep_segments | defined in subgroups section |

In order to configure PostgreSQL replication, add to your data.yaml a block similar to the one below to core section:

```yaml
kind: configuration/postgresql
title: PostgreSQL
name: default
specification:
  config_file:
    parameter_groups:
      ...
      # This block is optional, you can use it to override default values
      - name: REPLICATION
        subgroups:
          - name: Sending Server(s)
            parameters:
              - name: max_wal_senders
                value: 10 # default value
                comment: maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes
                when: replication # default value
              - name: wal_keep_segments
                value: 34 # default value
                comment: number of WAL files held for standby servers
                when: replication
          - name: Standby Servers
            parameters:
              - name: hot_standby
                value: 'on' # default value
                comment: capability to run read-only queries on standby server
                when: replication
  extensions:
    ...
    replication:
      enabled: true
      replication_user_name: your_postgresql_replication_user
      replication_user_password: your_postgresql_replication_password
      use_repmgr: false
      shared_preload_libraries: []
    ...
```

If `enabled` is set to `yes` in `replication`, then Epiphany will automatically create cluster of primary and secondary server
with replication user with name and password specified in data.yaml. This is only possible for configurations containing two
PostgreSQL servers.

## How to start working with OpenDistro for Elasticsearch

OpenDistro for Elasticsearch is [an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch enhanced with enterprise security, alerting, SQL](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/).
In order to start working with OpenDistro change machines count to value greater than 0 in your cluster configuration:

```yaml
kind: epiphany-cluster
...
specification:
  ...
  components:
    kubernetes_master:
      count: 1
      machine: aws-kb-masterofpuppets
    kubernetes_node:
      count: 0
    ...
    logging:
      count: 1
    opendistro_for_elasticsearch:
      count: 2
```

**Installation with more than one node will be always clustered** - Option to configure the non-clustered installation of more than one node for Open Distro is not supported.

```yaml
kind: configuration/opendistro-for-elasticsearch
title: OpenDistro for Elasticsearch Config
name: default
specification:
  cluster_name: EpiphanyElastic
```

By default Kibana is deployed only for `logging` component. If you want to deploy Kibana for `opendistro_for_elasticsearch` you have to modify feature mapping. Use below configuration in your manifest.
```yaml
kind: configuration/feature-mapping
title: "Feature mapping to roles"
name: default
specification:
  roles_mapping:
    opendistro_for_elasticsearch:
      - opendistro-for-elasticsearch
      - node-exporter
      - filebeat
      - firewall
      - kibana
```

Filebeat running on `opendistro_for_elasticsearch` hosts will always point to centralized logging hosts (./LOGGING.md).

## How to start working with Apache Ignite Stateful setup

Apache Ignite can be installed in Epiphany if `count` property for `ignite` feature is greater than 0.
Example:

```yaml
    ...
    load_balancer:
      count: 1
    ignite:
      count: 2
    rabbitmq:
      count: 0
    ...
```

Configuration like in this example will create Virtual Machines with Apache Ignite cluster installed.
There is possible to modify configuration for Apache Ignite and plugins used.

```yaml
kind: configuration/ignite
title: "Apache Ignite stateful installation"
name: default
specification:
  version: 2.7.6
  file_name: apache-ignite-2.7.6-bin.zip
  enabled_plugins:
  - ignite-rest-http
  config: |

Property `enabled_plugins` contains list with plugin names that will be enabled.
Property `config` contains xml configuration for Apache Ignite. Important placeholder variable is `IP_LIST_PLACEHOLDER` which will be replaced by automation with list of Apache Ignite nodes for self discovery.

## How to start working with Apache Ignite Stateless setup

Stateless setup of Apache Ignite is done using Kubernetes deployments. This setup uses standard `applications` Epiphany's feature (similar to `auth-service`, `rabbitmq`). To enable stateless Ignite deployment use following document:

```yaml
kind: configuration/applications
title: "Kubernetes Applications Config"
name: default
specification:
  applications:
  - name: ignite-stateless
    image_path: "apacheignite/ignite:2.5.0" # it will be part of the image path: {{local_repository}}/{{image_path}}
    namespace: ignite
    service:
      rest_nodeport: 32300
      sql_nodeport: 32301
      thinclients_nodeport: 32302
    replicas: 1
    enabled_plugins:
    - ignite-kubernetes # required to work on K8s
    - ignite-rest-http
```

Adjust this config to your requirements with number of replicas and plugins that should be enabled.
