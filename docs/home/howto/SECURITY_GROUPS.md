# Security Groups

This document describes the Security Groups layout which is used to deploy Epiphany Platform in AWS or Azure. You will find the default configuration here, as well as examples of adding own rules or changing existing ones.

## Introduction

By default Epiphany platform is creating security groups required to handle communication by all components (like postgress/rabbitmq etc). As per defaults, Epiphany creates a subnet per component and  each subnet has its own of security group, with rules that allow communication between them. This enables the smooth communication between all components. Please check our [security document](/docs/home/SECURITY.md) too. *Be aware, that whenever you want to add a new rule, you need to copy all default rules from mentioned above url*. That this document is splited into two parts: AWS and Azure. The reason why we do that, is that there are diffrent values in AWS and AZure, when setting the security rules.

## Setting own security groups

Sometimes, there is a need to set additional security rules for application which we're deploying in epiphany kubernetes cluster. Than, we need to stick into following rules:
- Whenever we want to add new rule - for example open port "X", we should *COPY* all current roles into our deployment .yaml file, and at the end, add the rule which we want.
- Each component has his own rule-set, so we need to be very carefull where we're putting them.
- After coping, we can also modify existing default security groups.
- After adding new rules, and infra part is done (terraform), we can go into terraform build directory and check if fiiles contain our port definition.

## Security groups diagram

Check bellow security diagram, which show how security groups are related to other components. This is example of AWS architecutre, but in Azure should be almost the same.

## Azure Security groups

List of all security groups and related services in Azure are described [here](/core/src/epicli/data/azure/defaults/infrastructure/virtual-machine.yml).

Rules description:
```yaml
- name:                       "Name of the rule"
  description:                "Short rule description"
  priority:                   "Priority (NUM), which describes which rules should be taken into conediration as first "
  direction:                  "Inbound || Outbound" - which direction are you allowing rule"
  access:                     "Allow|Deny - whenever we want to grant access or block"
  protocol:                   "TCP || UDP" - which protocol should be used for connections"
  source_port_range:          "Source port ranges"
  destination_port_range:     "Destination port/s range"
  source_address_prefix:      "Source network address"
  destination_address_prefix: "Destination network address"
```

Lets look into example on which, we are setting new rule name "nrpe-agent-port", with priority 250, which is allowing accesses from local network "10.1.4.0/24" into all hosts in our network on port 5666.

The rule:
```yaml
     - name: nrpe-agent-port
       description: Allow access all hosts on port 5666 where nagios agent is running.
       priority: 250
       direction: Inbound
       access: Allow
       protocol: Tcp
       source_port_range: "*"
       destination_port_range: "5666"
       source_address_prefix: "10.1.4.0/24"
       destination_address_prefix: "0.0.0.0/0"
```

## Azure Security groups full yaml file

To deploy previously mentioned rule, we need to setup a complete YAML configuraiton file. Bellow example shows how this file should looks like. In this configuration we set simple setup of epiphany with 2nodes and 1 master vm in Azure.

## AWS Security groups

List of all security groups and related services in AWS are described [here](/core/src/epicli/data/aws/defaults/infrastructure/virtual-machine.yml).

Rules description:
```yaml
- name:                       "Name of the rule"
  description:                "Short rule description"
  direction:                  "Inbound || Egress" - which direction are you allowing rule"
  protocol:                   "TCP || UDP" - which protocol should be used for connections"
  destination_port_range:     "Destination port/s range"
  source_address_prefix:      "Source network address"
  destination_address_prefix: "Destination network address"
```

Lets look into example on which, we are setting new rule name "nrpe-agent-port", which is allowing accesses from local network "10.1.4.0/24" into all hosts in our network on port 5666.

The rule:
```yaml
     - name: nrpe-agent-port
       description: Allow access all hosts on port 5666 where nagios agent is running.
       direction: Inbound
       protocol: Tcp
       destination_port_range: "5666"
       source_address_prefix: "10.1.4.0/24"
       destination_address_prefix: "0.0.0.0/0"
```
