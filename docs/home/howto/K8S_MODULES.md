# K8S_MODULES

Previous modules approach that included:
* Azure Basic Infrastructure (AzBI) module
* Azure AKS (AzKS) module
* AWS Basic Infrastructure (AwsBI) module
* AWS EKS (AwsKS) module

has been depricated - Epiphany will no longer support usage of these modules.

For Kubernetes services (AKS and EKS) that can be used alongside Epiphany, please refer to [k8s-modules](https://github.com/hitachienergy/k8s-modules).
