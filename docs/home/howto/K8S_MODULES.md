# K8S_MODULES

Previous modules approach that included:
* [Azure Basic Infrastructure](https://github.com/epiphany-platform/m-azure-basic-infrastructure) (AzBI) module
* [Azure AKS](https://github.com/epiphany-platform/m-azure-kubernetes-service) (AzKS) module
* [AWS Basic Infrastructure](https://github.com/epiphany-platform/m-aws-basic-infrastructure) (AwsBI) module
* [AWS EKS](https://github.com/epiphany-platform/m-aws-kubernetes-service) (AwsKS) module

has been depricated - Epiphany will no longer support usage of these modules.

For Kubernetes services (AKS and EKS) that can be used alongside Epiphany, please refer to [k8s-modules](https://github.com/epiphany-platform/k8s-modules).
