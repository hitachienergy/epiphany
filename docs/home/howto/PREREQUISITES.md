## Run Epicli from Docker image

There are 2 ways to get the image, build it locally yourself or pull it from the Epiphany docker registry.

### Build Epicli image locally

1. Install the following dependencies:

    - Docker

2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the Epiphany repository:

```bash
TAG=$(cat VERSION)
docker build --file Dockerfile --tag epicli:${TAG} .
```

### Pull Epicli image from the registry

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hitachienergy/epicli:TAG
```

Where `TAG` should be replaced with an existing tag.

*Check [here](https://github.com/hitachienergy/epiphany/pkgs/container/epicli) for the available tags.*

### Running the Epicli image

To run the image:

```bash
docker run -it -v LOCAL_DIR:/shared --rm ghcr.io/hitachienergy/epicli:TAG
```

Where:
- `LOCAL_DIR` should be replaced with the local path to the directory for Epicli input (SSH keys, data yaml files) and output (logs, build states),
- `TAG` should be replaced with an existing tag.

*Check [here](https://github.com/hitachienergy/epiphany/pkgs/container/epicli) for the available tags.*

## Epicli development

For setting up en Epicli development environment please refer to this dedicated document [here.](./../DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Important notes

### Hostname requirements

Epiphany supports only a lowercase RFC 1123 subdomain that must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.',
and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

### Note for Windows users

- Watch out for the line endings conversion. By default, Git for Windows sets `core.autocrlf=true`. Mounting such files with Docker results in `^M` end-of-line character in the config files.
Use: [Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10418975/how-to-change-line-ending-settings) (`core.autocrlf=input`) or Checkout as-is, commit as-is (`core.autocrlf=false`). Be sure to use a text editor that can work with Unix line endings (e.g. Notepad++).

- Remember to allow Docker Desktop to mount drives in Settings -> Shared Drives

- Escape your paths properly:

  - Powershell example:
  ```bash
  docker run -it -v C:\Users\USERNAME\git\epiphany:/epiphany --rm epiphany-dev:
  ```
  - Git-Bash example:
  ```bash
  winpty docker run -it -v C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\git\\epiphany:/epiphany --rm epiphany-dev
  ```

- Mounting NTFS disk folders in a linux based image causes permission issues with SSH keys. When running either the development or deploy image:

1. Copy the certs on the image:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh/epiphany-operations/
    cp /epiphany/core/ssh/id_rsa* ~/.ssh/epiphany-operations/
    ```
2. Set the proper permission on the certs:

    ```bash
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/epiphany-operations/id_rsa*
    ```

### Note about proxies

To run Epicli behind a proxy, environment variables need to be set.

When running a development container (upper and lowercase are needed because of an issue with the Ansible dependency):

  ```bash
  export http_proxy="http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT"
  export https_proxy="https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT"
  export HTTP_PROXY="http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT"
  export HTTPS_PROXY="https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT"
  ```

Or when running from a Docker image (upper and lowercase are needed because of an issue with the Ansible dependency):

  ```bash
  docker run -it -v POSSIBLE_MOUNTS... -e HTTP_PROXY=http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT -e HTTPS_PROXY=http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT -e https_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT --rm IMAGE_NAME
  ```

### Note about custom CA certificates

In some cases it might be that a company uses custom CA certificates or CA bundles for providing secure connections. To use these with Epicli you can do the following:

#### Devcontainer

Note that for the comments below the filenames of the certificate(s)/bundle do not matter, only the extensions. The certificate(s)/bundle need to be placed here before building the devcontainer.

1. If you have one CA certificate you can add it here with the ```crt``` extension.
2. If you have multiple certificates in a chain/bundle you need to add them here individually with the ```crt``` extension and also add the single bundle with the ```pem``` extension containing the same certificates. This is needed because not all tools inside the container accept the single bundle.

#### Epicli release container

If you are running Epicli from one of the prebuilt release containers you can do the following to install the certificate(s):

  ```bash
  cp ./path/to/*.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
  chmod 644 /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/*.crt
  update-ca-certificates
  ```

If you plan to deploy on AWS you also need to add a separate configuration for ```Boto3``` which can either be done by a ```config``` file or setting the ```AWS_CA_BUNDLE``` environment variable. More information about for ```Boto3``` can be found [here.](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html)
