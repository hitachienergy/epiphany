# This resolves issues (related to the etcd encryption) causing upgrades to hang.
# Legacy clusters may have incomplete configs, thus it is corrected here, before any `kubeadm upgrade` command is executed.
# If config is incomplete, kubeadm rewrites the kube-apiserver.yaml manifest file without the etcd feature enabled.
# In turn, this causes Kuberentes components such as the controller-manager to lose ability to read internal (kube-system) secrets, then
# any upgrade attempt freezes and the cluster at hand becomes unusable.
