# On Ubuntu there is dependent 'repmgr-common' package.
# Till Epiphany v1.2.0 the latest version was installed as dependency.
# apt module doesn't support --allow-downgrades (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/29451)
# so we keep installed version if it's newer. This workaround should be removed in the future.
